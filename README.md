# CARADISIAC

 [Introduction](#Install) Download both of caradisiac and my_projet. In both of the files, do an npm install. After this, install the 
node-car-api (npm install https://github.com/92bondstreet/node-car-api.git). Install elasticsearch. [Launching](#Launching) Launch the elasticsearch, it should listen
to the right port by default. Then, do an "npm start" in the caradisiac repository, as well as in the my_projet repository. [Enjoy](#Enjoy) You should see the list.
[Problem](#Problem) If you encounter a problem, it comes from the CORS. I don't understand what is it, but downloading CORS Toggle plugin resolves the problem. (See the pictures enclosed)
[Helper](#Helper) We (GOSSELIN and GOUIN) did this project, Charles did the back-end part and Alexandre did the front-end part.
