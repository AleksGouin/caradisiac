##Install Download both of caradisiac and my_projet. In both of the files, do an npm install. After this, install the  node-car-api (npm install https://github.com/92bondstreet/node-car-api.git). Install elasticsearch. 
##Launching Launch the elasticsearch, it should listen to the right port by default. Then, do an "npm start" in the caradisiac repository, as well as in the my_projet repository. 
##Enjoy Go to your favourite browser, and check for localhost:8000, it should display the list of the models of Peugeot and the volume of their car trunk.
##Problem If you encounter a problem, it comes from the CORS. I don't understand what is it, but downloading CORS Toggle plugin resolves the problem. (See the pictures enclosed)
